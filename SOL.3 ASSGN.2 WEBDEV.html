        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).
        Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses,
        and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering,
        Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration,
        and e-commerce development.

        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and 
        coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical 
        skills.
 
        For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard
        methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting 
        developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician.
