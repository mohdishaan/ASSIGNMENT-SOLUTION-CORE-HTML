    <p> HELLO EVERYONE, My name is <strong> Mohammad Ishaan</strong> and currently I am doing <strong> Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science specialised with Data 
       Science</strong>. I am doing my engineering in ABESIT College located in ghaziabad,Uttar Pradesh affiliated with Abdul Kalam Technical University.
       My most favourite subject till now is one and only <strong> DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM.</strong> My residence is in delhi and I am living
       here for the last 20 years. I have completed my high school from CBSE Board. I got <strong>91%</strong> in my 12th boards. I have my dream 
       to be an Engineer and doing my best to be a very honest and excellent Engineer. I have enrolled myself with pwskills course -
       <mark><strong><ins>FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT</ins></strong></mark> just to enhance my skill set and to have upper hand in everything. I have been enjoying
       till now in this course. The teachers are teaching with full dedication and hardwork and are making sure that students are understanding well 
       and they also engaged themselves in our doubts frequently within the lectures.
       <br>
